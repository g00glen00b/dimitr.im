When writing an application, eventually you may have to secure it. In this article I'll go over the various things you can do with [Angular](https://angular.io/) to handle the authentication of your application.

### ngrx

As mentioned in my last article, the authentication state is application-wide, and is easier to manage when you use a library as [@ngrx/store](https://github.com/ngrx/platform). This allows you to publish your state to all subscribers. Be sure to read [this article](/ngrx-store/) before starting with this one.

### Showing/hiding elements

If you want to show elements depending on a user being logged in or not, you can create your own [directive](https://angular.io/api/core/Directive) to hide the element. First of all, you need to create a directive:

```
ng g directive auth/is-authenticated
```

After that, you'll have to inject the following dependencies:

- A reference to the template, which is [`TemplateRef`](https://angular.io/api/core/TemplateRef)
- A reference to the container holding the element, such as [`ViewContainerRef`](https://angular.io/api/core/ViewContainerRef)
- The ngrx `Store`, to subscribe to changes happening to the authentication

```typescript
constructor(private templateRef: TemplateRef<an>>, private viewContainer: ViewContainerRef, private _store: Store<AppState>) {
}
```

The next step is to create a function that will either create an element if the user is logged in, or clear the elements within the container if the user is logged out:

```typescript
renderElementOnAuthenticated(auth: Authentication) {
  if (auth.token != null) {
    this.viewContainer.createEmbeddedView(this.templateRef);
  } else {
    this.viewContainer.clear();
  }
}
```

In my case, a `auth.token` will only be available when the user is logged in, so that's why I check upon that.

After that, you have to use the [`OnInit`](https://angular.io/api/core/OnInit) hook to subscribe to the store and to link it to the function we just wrote:

```typescript
ngOnInit(): void {
  this.subscription = this._store
    .select(state => state.auth)
    .subscribe(auth => this.renderElementOnAuthenticated(auth));
  }
```

Also, note that I'm storing the subscription in a separate field called `this.subscription`. This is necessary to prevent memory leaks from happening due to subscriptions staying open, even after a component or a directive has been destroyed. The final step is to actually unsubscribe when you're destroying the directive, by implementing [`OnDestroy`](https://angular.io/api/core/OnDestroy) and adding the following lifecycle hook:

```typescript
ngOnDestroy(): void {
  this.subscription.unsubscribe();
}
```

Now you can use the directive everywhere, such as:

```html
<clr-dropdown clrMenuPosition="bottom-right" *appIsAuthenticated="">
  <button class="nav-icon" clrDropdownToggle>
    <clr-icon shape="user"></clr-icon>
    <clr-icon shape="caret down"></clr-icon>
  </button>
  <div class="dropdown-menu">
    <span class="dropdown-item disabled">Welcome {{profile?.username}}</span>
    <div class="dropdown-divider"></div>
    <a href="" clrDropdownItem [routerLink]="['/profile/edit']" [routerLinkActive]="['active']">Edit profile</a>
    <a href="" clrDropdownItem (click)="logout($event)">Log out</a>
  </div>
</clr-dropdown>
```

The code example above uses the `*appIsAuthenticated` directive to hide the entire dropdown if the user is not logged in. The `*` clarifies that the directive is a [structural directive](https://angular.io/guide/structural-directives) and alters the DOM.

### Guarding routes

Another thing you can do is to make routes unavailable if a user shouldn't have access to them. This can be useful to shield routes that should be inaccessible when the user is not logged in, or when he doesn't have enough permissions, such as an admin page.

A guard isn't that difficult, the first thing you need to do is to implement [`CanActivate`](https://angular.io/api/router/CanActivate):

```typescript
@Injectable()
export class AuthenticatedGuard implements CanActivate {

}
```

After that, you need to implement the `canActivate()` function:

```typescript
canActivate(): boolean {
  return this.authenticated;
}
```

In my case, I used a field called `authenticated` that will be either `true` or `false` depending on if the token is present in the authenticatio object, just like we did in the directive before:

```typescript
authenticated: boolean = false;

constructor(private _store: Store<AppState>) {
  this._store
    .select(state => state.auth)
    .subscribe(authentication => this.authenticated = authentication.token != null);
}
```

That's all you need to implement a route guard. Now that we've written the guard, you can add it to your route configuration:

```typescript
const routes: Routes = [
  {path: 'articles', component: ArticlesComponent},
  {path: 'articles/new', component: NewArticleComponent, canActivate: [AuthenticatedGuard]},
  {path: 'articles/:slug/edit', component: EditArticleComponent, canActivate: [AuthenticatedGuard]},
  {path: 'articles/:slug', component: ArticleDetailComponent}
];
```

As you can see in the example above, the `ArticlesComponent` and the `ArticleDetailComponent` are accessible to everyone, but creating a new article or editing an article depends on the user being authenticated, so we used the [`canActivate`](https://angular.io/api/router/Route#canActivate) property of the route to add our guard.

### Intercepting HTTP calls

We've been using the token a lot now to check if a user is authenticated. But we actually need to send the token with each request as well. Otherwise the REST API would complain that the user is authenticated. Obviously you could add the token to every HTTP call you make. But most of the time it's easier to automagically add the correct headers to the request. This is where writing a HTTP interceptor becomes interesting. Be aware, we're using the new [`HttpClient`](https://angular.io/api/common/http/HttpClient) API here, so this example only works for Angular 4 and beyond.

First of all, we need a new class, for example:

```
ng g class auth/auth-http-interceptor
```

The next step is to make your new class to implement the [`HttpInterceptor`](https://angular.io/api/common/http/HttpInterceptor) interface:

```typescript
@Injectable()
export class AuthHttpInterceptor implements HttpInterceptor {

}
```

By implementing this method, you also need to implement the `intercept` function:

```typescript
intercept(req: HttpRequest<any>, next: HttpHandler): Observable<HttpEvent<any>> {
  const authReq = req.clone({ headers: req.headers.set('X-Token', this.token) });
  return next.handle(authReq);
}
```

This function pass two parameters, the first one being the original [`HttpRequest`](https://angular.io/api/common/http/HttpRequest) and the second one being the [`HttpHandler`](https://angular.io/api/common/http/HttpHandler), which basically is used to chain interceptors.

The implementation clones the request, and adds a new header, in my case being `X-Token` passing the actual token. But this could be anything. If your application uses basic authentication, you probably want to add something like this in stead:

```typescript
const authReq = req.clone({ headers: req.headers.set('Authorization', `Basic ${btoa('${this.username}:${this.password}')}`) });
```

Next to this, we also have to set either the `this.token` field or the `this.username` and `this.password` fields. To do that, we rely on ngrx once more. (Did I already mention that you should really check out my article about ngrx?)

```typescript
token: String;

constructor(private _store: Store<AppState>) {
  this._store
    .select(state => state.auth)
    .subscribe(authentication => this.token = authentication.token);
}
```

Now that we defined the interceptor, it's time to actually add it to the providers. To do this, you can open the `AppModule` and add the following to the `providers` array in the `@NgModule` decorator:

```typescript
providers: [{ provide: HTTP_INTERCEPTORS, useClass: AuthHttpInterceptor, multi: true}]
```

Make sure to import [`HTTP_INTERCEPTORS`](https://angular.io/api/common/http/HTTP_INTERCEPTORS) from `@angular/common/http`:

```typescript
import {HTTP_INTERCEPTORS} from '@angular/common/http';
```

### Conclusion

There are many things that can be done when using Angular. In this article I checked the route guards, directives and the HTTP interceptors. If there's anything else you might come up with, make sure to mention it in the comments!
