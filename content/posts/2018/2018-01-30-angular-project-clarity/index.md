When working at an Angular project, there are many choices for a UI kit. You have [Angular Material](https://material.angular.io/), [ng-bootstrap](https://ng-bootstrap.github.io/#/home) and a few more. My favourite UI kit is probably [Project Clarity](http://clarity.design), open sourced by VMWare.

### Installing the dependencies

While the documentation provides you with a lot of information to get started with an Angular seed project, there isn't much information available for when you create a project with [Angular CLI](https://cli.angular.io/). Luckily for us, most steps are similar.

First of all, you need to install the proper dependencies:

```
npm install --save @clr/icons @clr/ui @clr/angular @webcomponents/custom-elements@1.0.0
```

As mentioned in the [Getting started](https://vmware.github.io/clarity/documentation/v0.11/get-started) guide, the libraries are being used for:

- **@clr/ui**: The CSS files for the user interface of Clarity
- **@clr/icons**: A library for the [Clarity icons](https://vmware.github.io/clarity/icons/clarity-icons), a beautiful iconset, which you could even use without using the Clarity UI
- **@clr/angular**: A library containing the Angular components to use within your project
- **@webcomponents/custom-elements**: A polyfill for custom web elements

### Configuring .angular-cli.json

The next step is to configure Angular CLI properly to load the styles and scripts. To do this, you need to open the **.angular-cli.json** file, and you need to search for the `styles` section. In here, you need to add the Clarity UI and icons CSS files:

```json
"styles": \[
  "../node\_modules/@clr/ui/clr-ui.min.css",
  "../node\_modules/@clr/icons/clr-icons.min.css",
  "styles.css"
\],
```

The `"styles.css"` entry is generated by Angular CLI, and should be kept there if you like to add custom styles by yourself later on.

Then immediately below the `styles` section, there should be an empty `scripts` section. In here, you need to add the JavaScript files for the iconset and the custom web elements:

```json
"scripts": [
  "../node_modules/@webcomponents/custom-elements/custom-elements.min.js",
  "../node_modules/@clr/icons/clr-icons.min.js"
],
```

### Importing the module

The final step to get started is to import the `ClarityModule` in your appliation. You can do this by opening **app.module.ts** and importing the module:

```typescript
@NgModule({
  declarations: [
    AppComponent
  ],
  imports: [
    BrowserModule,
    ClarityModule // This is new
  ],
  providers: [],
  bootstrap: [AppComponent]
})
export class AppModule { }
```

To do this, you also have to add the `import` statement:

```typescript
import {ClarityModule} from '@clr/angular';
```

Now you're set!

### Testing it out

To test it out, open **app.component.html** and replace the generated content by:

```html
<clr-main-container>
  <div class="content-container">
    <main class="content-area">
      <h1>Hello world!</h1>
      <clr-alert>
        <div clr-alert-item class="alert-item">
          <span class="alert-text">
            We can now use Clarity!
          </span>
        </div>
      </clr-alert>
    </main>
  </div>
</clr-main-container>
```

If you run the application now, using the `ng serve` command, the page should look a bit like this:

![Clarity hello world](content/posts/2018/2018-01-30-angular-project-clarity/images/Screenshot-2018-01-13-10.43.35.png)

If that's the case, then you are now ready to use Project Clarity!

### Using the dark theme

Recently, Clarity also [introduced the dark theme](https://medium.com/claritydesignsystem/going-dark-generating-claritys-dark-theme-59486c24fe9c). If you want to try this out, you need to make the following change.

Open **.angular-cli.json**, and replace the `styles` section by:

```json
"styles": [
  "../node_modules/@clr/ui/clr-ui-dark.min.css",
  "../node_modules/@clr/icons/clr-icons.min.css",
  "styles.css"
],
```

After that, the application should look like this:

![Clarity dark theme hello world](content/posts/2018/2018-01-30-angular-project-clarity/images/Screenshot-2018-01-13-10.48.28.png)

And there you have it, a nice looking application with Angular and Project Clarity!
