In [my previous tutorial](/spring-data-jpa/) I wrote a small Spring boot application that retrieved data from a database and showed it on a webpage. However, we only handled the happy path, usually stuff may go wrong when retrieving data or doing certain operations.

### Project setup

For this project I'm going to be using the same dependencies as my previous tutorial. Which means you could go to start.spring.io and you add the following dependencies:

- **JPA**: Dependency to use Spring Data JPA
- **MySQL**: MySQL JDBC driver for connecting to a database (you could choose another driver as well if you know what you're doing!)
- **Web**: Dependency for creating web applications
- **Thymeleaf**: Template engine

Once you've done that you can import the project in your IDE. For the database setup I'm also gonna use the same example as in my previous example. I installed a MySQL database and executed the following script:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE demo;

USE demo;

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `superhero` (
  `id` INT(11) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  `name` VARCHAR(32) NOT NULL,
  `first_name` VARCHAR(32),
  `last_name` VARCHAR(32),
  `good` bit(1),
  PRIMARY KEY (`id`)
) ENGINE=InnoDB  DEFAULT CHARSET=latin1;

INSERT INTO `superhero` (`name`, `first_name`, `last_name`, `good`) VALUES
  ('Superman', 'Clark', 'Kent', 1),
  ('Silver Banshee', 'Siobhan', 'McDougal', 0);
```

After that I also changed the properties of the Spring boot application (**application.properties**) to contain the credentials to connect to the database:

```
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/demo
spring.datasource.username=root
spring.datasource.password=123456
spring.jpa.database-platform=org.hibernate.dialect.MySQLDialect
```

Using YAML (**application.yml**) that would be:

```yaml
spring:
  datasource:
    url: jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/demo
    username: root
    password: 123456
  jpa:
    database-platform: org.hibernate.dialect.MySQLDialect
```

### Creating an entity

I'm using the same data as in my previous tutorial, so the entity is just the same:

```java
@Entity
@Table(name = "superhero")
public class Superhero {
    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.AUTO)
    @Column(name = "id")
    private Long id;
    @Column(name = "first_name")
    private String firstName;
    @Column(name = "last_name")
    private String lastName;
    @Column(name = "name")
    private String name;
    @Column(name = "good")
    private boolean good;

    public Long getId() {
        return id;
    }

    public String getFirstName() {
        return firstName;
    }
    public void setFirstName(String firstName) {
        this.firstName = firstName;
    }

    public String getLastName() {
        return lastName;
    }
    public void setLastName(String lastName) {
        this.lastName = lastName;
    }

    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }
    public void setName(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    public boolean isGood() {
        return good;
    }
    public void setGood(boolean good) {
        this.good = good;
    }
}
```

The repository is also, still the same:

```java
public interface SuperheroRepository extends JpaRepository<Superhero , Long> {
}
```

If you want a more detailed explanation about what this all does, I really recommend you to read my previous tutorial. ^^

### Creating a service

In my other tutorials I directly used the repository within my controller, or I directly used mock data in my controller. Normally you would wrap that in a service, because a controller is not exactly responsible for handling all that.

But before we start with an implementation, let's create an interface describing the service:

```java
public interface SuperheroService {
    List<Superhero> findAll();
}
```

In this example I'm only have to create a method to retrieve all superheroes. The implementation of that service would look like this:

```java
@Service
public class SuperheroServiceImpl implements SuperheroService {
    @Autowired
    private SuperheroRepository repository;

    @Override
    public List<Superhero> findAll() {
        return repository.findAll();
    }
}
```

### Controller

Finally we can start writing our controller and wrapping things up:

```java
@Controller
@RequestMapping("/superhero")
public class SuperheroController {
    @Autowired
    private SuperheroService service;

    @RequestMapping
    public ModelAndView getSuperheroes() {
        return new ModelAndView("superheroes", "superheroes", service.findAll());
    }
}
```

The view will look like this:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.5/css/bootstrap.min.css" />
</head>
<body>
<div class="container">
  <table class="table">
    <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>#</th>
      <th>Hero name</th>
      <th>Real name</th>
      <th>Good</th>
    </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
    <tr th:each="hero, status : ${superheroes}">
      <td th:text="${status.count}">1</td>
      <td th:text="${hero.name}">Hero name</td>
      <td th:text="${hero.firstName + ' ' + hero.lastName}">Real name</td>
      <td>
        <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-ok" th:if="${hero.good}"></span>
        <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-remove" th:unless="${hero.good}"></span>
      </td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
</div>
</body>
</html>
```

With this, we created an exact replica of the code in our previous tutorial. The only exception is that we now have a service in between the controller and the repository. But what about the error handling you were talking about at the start of the article?

### Introducing the non-happy path

Now, the reason I wrote a service is because it allows me to create additional behaviour that may lead to errors. For some whacky reason I'm going to add a 20% chance that the `findAll()` method will fail and throw an exception. Why? Because I like breaking things!

In stead of the really simple `findAll()` method in our service, I'm going to replace it by this:

```java
@Override
public List<Superhero> findAll() {
    if (Math.random() < 0.8) {
        return repository.findAll();
    } else {
        throw new SuperheroesUnavailableException("Superheroes are unavailable because it has 20% chance to fail");
    }
}
```

Obviously, you will never write such a thing, and even if you do you should probably be using a random + seed to improve testability. Anyways, for simplicity of being able to test the non-happy paths, I wrote this code.

Obviously you will also need to create your own `SuperheroesUnavailableException` class, mine looks like this:

```java
public class SuperheroesUnavailableException extends RuntimeException {
    public SuperheroesUnavailableException(String message) {
        super(message);
    }
}
```

Now, if we run the application and press refresh a few times (the lucky people might encounter it without refreshing), you'll see a weird page titled **Whitelabel Error Page**.

![whitelabel-error-page](content/posts/2016/2016-01-19-handling-errors-with-spring-mvc/images/whitelabel-error-page.png)

### Exception handlers

While Spring Boot already provides default exception handlers, we probably want our own. To do that, we open the `SuperheroController` and add the following method:

```java
@ExceptionHandler({SuperheroesUnavailableException.class})
public ModelAndView getSuperheroesUnavailable(SuperheroesUnavailableException ex) {
    return new ModelAndView("superheroes", "error", ex.getMessage());
}
```

So, by providing a method with the `@ExceptionHandler` annotation, we can handle specific kind of exceptions. In this case we only want to handle the `SuperheroesUnavailableException` we just made. To handle the error, I'm going to be using the same view as the original one, but in stead of using the `"superheroes"` model, I'm going to use the `"error"` model and add the exception message.

The last step is to alter the view (**superheroes.html**), to add the following piece of HTML below the `<table>`:

```html
<p class="alert alert-danger" th:if="${error != null}" th:text="${error}"></p>
```

This will show an error message when the error model is not null. So, 80% of the time the message will not be visible. If the error occurs on the other hand, the message will be visible.

### Testing it out

To test it out, you'll have to run the application again and refresh several times until you get the error message popping up.
