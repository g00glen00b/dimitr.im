The last few weeks, I've covered how to [use Gatsby with WordPress](/using-gatsby-with-wordpress-as-a-headless-cms/), and with [JSON files](/using-json-with-gatsby/). Today, I'm going to show you how you can use Gatsby with [Craft CMS](https://craftcms.com/).

Craft CMS is a flexible, feature-rich content management system. One of the major differences between WordPress and Craft CMS is that the latter relies on matrix fields in stead of a regular WYSIWYG editor. This allows you to add multiple types of content to a single post.  
In addition, it doesn't rely on certain templates like WordPress does, and thus, gives designers and developers more of a clean slate when it comes to customization.  
Another nice thing is that it comes with [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) support out of the box. That means we can easily integrate it with [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/).

### Configuring the GraphQL schema

By default, Craft CMS already exposes a public GraphQL schema to the public. This schema only exposes a "ping" endpoint, and wouldn't be useful for our purpose.  
To configure what's exposed, you first have to go to the Craft CMS dashboard. Within the dashboard, you have to select **GraphQL** and then **Schemas**. In here, you can either select the **Public Schema**, or create a new one and apply authentication.

After selecting or creating a schema, you can change the exact scope of what's being exposed. In my case, I've exposed all blog entry types, and the assets.  
Once changed, you can try writing a query by going to **GraphQL** and then selecting **Explore**.

The queries you can execute, depend mostly on what you enabled, and what type of entities you use on Craft CMS. In my case, I can fetch all blogposts with their featured image by using the following query:

```graphql
query {
  entries(typeId: 8) {
    ... on blog_blog_Entry {
      title
      uri
      postDate @formatDateTime(format: "M d, Y")
      fieldMedia {
        title
        url
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Important to know is that the type `blog_blog_Entry` depends on what entry types you declared. Normally, Craft CMS will provide an autocomplete containing which types are available.

![Autocomplete of GraphQL types](content/posts/2020/2020-03-10-gatsby-craft-cms/images/graphql-schema-autocomplete-craftcms.png)

Now that you know how to change the schema and execute queries, it's time to get started with Gatsby.

### Setting up a Gatsby project

As usual, a new Gatsby project can be created with the Gatsby CLI:

```
gatsby new my-craft-cms-blog
```

After the CLI created your project, we first have to install the `gatsby-source-graphql` dependency. This dependency allows us to use third-party GraphQL schemas with Gatsby.

```
cd my-craft-cms-blog
npm install --save gatsby-source-graphql
```

After that, you're ready to start developing.

### Configuring Gatsby

The first step when setting up Gatsby, is to configure the plugins you're using. Since we just installed the `gatsby-source-graphql` plugin, we'll have to configure it first.  
To do this, open **gatsby-config.js**. In here, add a new entry to the **plugins** section. For example:

```javascript
{
  resolve: `gatsby-source-graphql`,
  options: {
    typeName: 'CraftAPI',
    fieldName: 'craftAPI',
    url: 'https://example.org/actions/graphql/api'
  }
}
```

In case you're using a private schema, you'll have to copy over the access token, and use it like this:

```javascript
{
  resolve: `gatsby-source-graphql`,
  options: {
    typeName: 'CraftAPI',
    fieldName: 'craftApi',
    url: 'https://example.org/actions/graphql/api',
    headers: {
      Authorization: `Bearer ${process.env.AUTHENTICATION_TOKEN}`
    }
  }
}
```

Now you'll be able to run the application using `npm start`. If you're using an authentication token, you can use:

```
AUTHENTICATION_TOKEN=my-token npm start
```

### Creating an index page

Once you've set up your Gatsby project, and it's up and running, it's time to explore the page components. By default, you'll get an **index.js** and a **page-2.js** file within the **src/pages** folder.

We don't really need the "page-2.js" file, so let's look at the "index.js" page in stead. By default, it has some dummy content, but in our case, we would prefer to show a list of all of our Craft CMS entries.

To do this, we can write a query like this:

```javascript
const allEntriesQuery = graphql`
  {
    craftApi {
      entries {
        ... on CraftAPI_blog_blog_Entry {
          id
          title 
          uri
          postDate
          fieldMedia {
            url
          }   
        }
      }
    }
  }
`;
```

This query looks almost identical to the one we used before. One important difference is that you'll have to use the name configured within `fieldName` as the operation you want to use. In my case, I configured it as `craftApi`, and thus, I have to call it that way.

Additionally, Gatsby prefixes all types using the `typeName` configuration. In my case, I called it `CraftAPI` and thus, `blog_blog_Entry` now became `CraftAPI_blog_blog_Entry`.

To actually use the query within the index page, we can use the `useStaticQuery()` React hook. This hook is provided by Gatsby, and will return the response of the call.

In my case, I'm interested in looping over all `entries`, and thus I wrote the following within the `IndexPage` component:

```javascript
const {craftApi: {entries}} = useStaticQuery(allEntriesQuery);
```

Once done, you can use the entries in a normal React component. For example, I defined a `<Post/>` component, and called it like this:

```javascript
{entries.map(({id, title, uri, postDate, fieldMedia: [{url: mediaUrl} = {}] = []}) => <Post
  key={id}
  title={title}
  uri={uri}
  postDate={postDate}
  mediaUrl={mediaUrl}
/>)}
```

Sadly, directives from the original schema aren't stitched together with the schema provided by Gatsby, and thus, the `@formatDateTime` directive can't be used. Neither does Gatsby recognize this field as a date type, and thus Gatsby's date filtering doesn't work here either.

In my case, I ended up using `Intl.DateTimeFormat()` to format the given date. Libraries like [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/) could also solve this problem for you, but are a bit more heavy-weight.

```jsx
const dateFormat = new Intl.DateTimeFormat('en-US', {
  year: 'numeric',
  month: 'long',
  day: 'numeric'
});

export const Post = ({title, uri, postDate, mediaUrl}) => (
  <Link to={uri}>
    <img src={mediaUrl} alt="Featured media"/>
    <h2>{title}</h2>
    <time>{dateFormat.format(new Date(postDate))}</time>
  </Link>
);
```

If you're done with the component, and you add some CSS, you could end up with a result like this:

![Screenshot of the index page built with Gatsby](images/gatsby-index-page-craftcms-1024x726.png)

This is a copy of the blogposts from the website of the comany I work for, [optis.be](https://www.optis.be/blog).

If you're experiencing any diffulties when fetching the `fieldMedia` field, make sure that you enabled retrieving assets within the GraphQL schema.

### Adding new pages

While the index page works fine now, clicking any article results in a 404 page. This happens because Gatsby isn't aware yet about the pages we want to declare.

To do this, we can use the `createPages` API within the **gatsby-node.js** file. I've explained this more in detail in [my tutorial about dynamically creating new pages](/creating-pages-with-gatsby/).

In my case, I want to create a page for every blogpost, so I'll be using a similar query as I wrote before:

```javascript
const allEntriesQuery = `
  {
    craftApiApi {
      entries {
        ... on CraftAPI_blog_blog_Entry {
          id 
          uri
        }
      }
    }
  }
`;

exports.createPages = ({graphql, actions: {createPage}}) => {
  return graphql(allEntriesQuery).then(({errors, data: {craftApi: {entries}}}) => {
    if (errors) throw new errors;
    return entries.map(({id, uri}) => createPage({
      path: uri,
      component: path.resolve('./src/templates/post.js'),
      context: {id: parseInt(id)}
    }));
  });
};
```

This setup will generate a new page for every post, based on the **src/templates/post.js** template.

### Creating the detail page

Since we don't have a detail page yet, I'm going to copy the contents of the index.js page to a new file called **src/templates/post.js**.

Now, the next step is to fetch the data. Within the index page, we used the `useStaticQuery()` React hook to get our data. This way of fetching data, will no longer work, as we're not dealing with a static query.

In this example, we'll have to fetch the entry with a given ID. With Gatsby, we can do that by exporting a field called `query`:

```javascript
export const query = graphql`
  query ($id: [Int]) {
    craftApi {
      entries(id: $id) {
        ... on CraftAPI_blog_blog_Entry {
          title
          postDate
        }
      }
    }
  }
`;
```

The nice part about Gatsby is that it automatically injects parameters passed to the context (see `gatsby-node.js`) as a variable to the given query. In my case, I declared the `id` field onto the context, and thus, the above query will be all we need to fetch the data.

### Getting the detail blocks

As I've mentioned at the beginning of this article, the way entries are created with Craft CMS, isn't through a normal WYSIWYG editor. In stead of that, you'll have to declare various types of blocks within each entry.

To be able to create a complete remake of a detail page within Gatsby, we'll have to fetch all these blocks. We can do this by querying the `fieldContent` field within each entry. For example:

```javascript
export const query = graphql`
  query ($id: [Int]) {
    craftApi {
      entries(id: $id) {
        ... on CraftAPI_blog_blog_Entry {
          title
          postDate
          fieldContent {
            ... on CraftAPI_fieldContent_itemTitle_BlockType {
              id
              itemTitle
            }
            ... on CraftAPI_fieldContent_itemText_BlockType {
              id
              itemText
            }
            ... on CraftAPI_fieldContent_codeBlock_BlockType {
              id
              code
            }
            ... on CraftAPI_fieldContent_itemLink_BlockType {
              id
              itemLink
            }
            ... on CraftAPI_fieldContent_itemMedia_BlockType {
              id
              itemMedia {
                title
                url
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
`;
```

In this example, I'm using five different content block types, being titles, text, code, media and links.

To properly render all these different blocks, I created a new component called `<PostContent/>`, which will do the heavy lifting:

```jsx
export const PostContent = ({fieldContent}) => (
  <>
    {fieldContent.map(({id, itemTitle, itemText, code, itemLink, title, itemMedia}) => {
      if (itemTitle != null) return <h2 key={id}>{itemTitle}</h2>;
      else if (itemText != null) return <div key={id} dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{__html: itemText}}/>;
      else if (code != null) return <pre key={id}>{code}</pre>;
      else if (itemLink != null) return <a key={id} href={itemLink}>{title}</a>;
      else if (itemMedia != null) return <img key={id} src={itemMedia[0].url} alt={itemMedia[0].title}/>;
      else return null;
    })}
  </>
);
```

Depending on which field isn't `null` (or `undefined`), we can determine the block type, and determine which tags we'll use. For example, for a title block we'll use a `<h2/>` element, for a code block a `<pre/>` element and so on.

Since the `itemText` field can contain HTML code, it's recommended to use the `dangerouslySetInnerHtml={{__html: itemText}}` attribue.

### Using the data within the post template

Earlier on, we exported a query within the post.js template. The data that is being fetched in such cases will be available as a parameter within your component.

This allows you to utilize the `<PostContent/>` component I wrote earlier on:

```jsx
const PostPage = ({data: {craftApi: {entries: [{title, postDate, fieldContent}]}}}) => {
  return (
    <Layout>
      <SEO title={title} />
      <div className="content">
        <h1>{title}</h1>
        <time>{dateFormat.format(new Date(postDate))}</time>
        <PostContent fieldContent={fieldContent}/>
      </div>
    </Layout>
  );
};
```

If you run the application now, you'll see that clicking on a detail page results in the page properly being rendered:

![Screenshot of the detail page built with Gatsby](content/posts/2020/2020-03-10-gatsby-craft-cms/images/gatsby-detail-page-craftcms.png)

And there you have it, you're now able to build a blazing fast static website on top of Craft CMS.
