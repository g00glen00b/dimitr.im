The last few days of 2014 are passing by. On these days, people look back and make year overviews and top lists of the entire year. If I have to look back at **wordpress.g00glen00b.be** for the past year, I can say that a lot of things changed.

### Neder... ehhh English

If you look at the current top articles, you will notice that they're all written in English. Most Dutch posts are already buried, far away where nobody can find them. But yeah, before 2014, all articles that were written, where written in Dutch, not English. I'm keeping the old articles in their original language, but if someone requests it, I'll translate those articles to English as well, like I did with some articles ([1](/dojo-inheritance-overriding-extending/ "Dojo inheritance, overriding & extending"), [2](/dojo-promises-deferreds/ "Dojo promises & Deferreds"), [3](/dojo-publisher-subscriber/ "Dojo publisher & subscriber"), [4](/dojo-require-vs-define/ "Dojo require vs define") and [5](/dojo-domready-vs-ready/ "Dojo domReady vs ready")).

### One hundred articles

One of my goals for 2014 was to get past the 100 articles. And yes, currently the counter stands at **112 articles**, 36 of them were written during the last year. The most visited articles are:

1. [Writing real time applications using Spring, AngularJS and WebSockets](/spring-websockets/ "Writing real time applications using Spring, AngularJS and WebSockets")
2. [Making your AngularJS application grunt](/angular-grunt/ "Making your AngularJS application grunt")
3. [Using WebSockets with Spring, AngularJS and SockJS](/spring-angular-sockjs/ "Using WebSockets with Spring, AngularJS and SockJS") (= a reboot of the first article)

If you didn't check them out yet, make sure to read them.

### You!

Of course, the most important thing is you! In 2014, the website gained a lot more attention than before. If I take a look at the analytics, I can see that the amount of traffic on this website is increasing every week.

And with that, I would like to end this article and to say **THANK YOU!**
