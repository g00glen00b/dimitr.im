If you're hoping to find an e-mail address here, I'm sorry to disappoint you.
I used to have a public e-mail address and even a contact form, but 99% of the mails I got were spam.

I'm still open for questions, suggestions, ideas or other feedback though.
The easiest way to contact me is through [Twitter](https://twitter.com/g00glen00b).
Either mention me in a tweet or send me a DM (my DMs are open).

Alternatively, you can open an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/g00glen00b/dimitr.im).

Each blog post also has a comment section powered by [utteranc.es](https://utteranc.es/) and GitHub.
